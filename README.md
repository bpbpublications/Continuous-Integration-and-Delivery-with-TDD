## About the Book
As software complexity grows, quality and delivery speed increasingly rely on automated pipelines. This practical guide equips readers to construct robust CI/CD workflows that boost productivity and reliability. Step-by-step walkthroughs detail the technical implementation of continuous practices, while real-world case studies showcase solutions tailored for diverse systems and organizational needs.

Master CI/CD, crucial for modern software development, with this book. It compares traditional versus test-driven development, stressing testing's importance. In this book, we will explore CI/CD's principles, benefits, and DevOps integration. We will build robust pipelines covering containerization, version control, and infrastructure as code. Through this book, you will learn about effective CD with monitoring, security, and release management, you will learn how to optimize CI/CD for different scenarios and applications, emphasizing collaboration and automation for success.

With actionable best practices grounded in TDD principles, this book teaches how to leverage automated processes to cultivate shared ownership, design simplicity, comprehensive testing, and ultimately deliver exceptional business value.
